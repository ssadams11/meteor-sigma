# meteor-sigma

Sigma is a library dedicated to graph drawing. It makes easy to publish networks on Web pages, and allows developers to integrate network exploration in rich Web applications.
Forked from uzumaxy:meteor-sigma 1.0.3 to create a non-minified version to allow sigma.js debugging and enhancement.
